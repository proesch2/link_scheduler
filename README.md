# link_scheduler
This applications automatically opens links at certain times throughout the day read in by a CSV file schedule. It reads in the CSV file and stores in a local memory SQLite database that then queries on the minute any applicable links to open.

I personally use this a class schedule to open links for my courses throughout the day instead of having to find each respective link each time.
